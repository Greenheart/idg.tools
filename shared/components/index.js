// IDEA: In order to make the Svelte language server work as expected for TS and intellisense,
// we could make the shared components into a SvelteKit component library that can be used by all workspace projects.
// Then we can have a svelte config here which makes the Svelte language tools work as expected

// This would also remove the need to duplicate depdendencies for shared components
// both in the `shared` project and the projects where they are used.
// Instead, the component library would manage its own dependencies.
