 * By supporting backwards compatible links that end with a `cuid.slug()`,
 * we make it possible to find the same tool in multiple ways:
 * 1) /finding-your-inner-compass-105l07u
 * 2) /invalid-or-old-name-still-works-105l07u
 * 3) /105l07u
 *
 * With the third case, we get built-in support for short URLs. Not that easy to type, but at least they are few characters.
