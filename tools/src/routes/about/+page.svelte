            We are creating an open source library of scientifically-validated tools to develop the skills
            outlined by the IDG framework. Here you can find methods, workshops and resources relevant
            to the skills you want to practice.

            improvements, new tools or even design and develop the app. Read the principles of
            tools, and how to join the co-creation.
