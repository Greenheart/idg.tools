A key principle in teams is a common intention. For aligning a core team to create a shared sense of purpose and direction, initial framing is important. Presencing practitioners sense into the interior conditions, asking organisations to consider the quality of spaces they create for deep inner and relational inquiry. For example, how to see, sense and feel the inner quality of team dynamics. The U-school offers a set of tools and practices to support holding spaces for transformation: Sensing Journeys, Dialogue Interview, Stakeholder Interview, Guided Journaling, Case Clinic Coaching Circles, Prototyping, and more. These practices are freely accessible and can be used independently and adapted to other transformative processes. \n\n## How it can help\nTheory U offers insights and processes that enable working in a group to sense more deeply into team dynamics and conscious leadership relationships, helping organisations engage in purposeful planning, prototyping of projects and initiatives, and acting more purposefully.\n\n#### Learn more\n\nRead the [IDG Phase 2 Research Report](/assets/221215_IDG_Toolkit_v1.pdf) and get more in-depth information.","intro":"Theory U, also known as ‘Presencing’, offers a framework for collaboration and engagement using awareness-based and contemplative practices.It can help groups sense more deeply into team dynamics, and organisations engage in purposeful planning, prototyping of projects and initiatives, and acting more purposefully.","slug":"94b24hs","actions":"When starting with Theory U and in particular Prototyping for the first time, try the following:\n\n1.

Represent invisible forces, such as dynamics of feelings, for example, power, frustration, with an object. Also consider distance between objects as well as shape and size.\n\n3.

South (Truth): What hard truths need to be spoken? West (Reflection): What assumptions might be underlying this situation? What systemic barriers lock us into the current state of operating? North (Purpose/Presence): What in this situation is ending, wanting to die, and what is emerging, wanting to be born? If this sculpture could speak, what advice might it offer?\n\n4.

Our ability for compassion can also temporarily decrease, such as in stressful or hostile situations or if we get stuck in our own judgements or unhealthy self-criticisms or even shame. The ability for compassion and self-compassion is an asset, and fortunately, it can be trained and developed.\n\nCompassion training that we will focus on here can be performed by different exercises such as meditation training. A common way of doing this exercise is to start with mindful awareness - connecting to oneself, one’s body and breath. Compassion training often aims to address one’s own suffering, which is self-compassion, but here we will address relations and others’ suffering. Voluntary work helping disadvantaged people and being conscious about one’s consumption of different resources are examples of supporting and connecting with other people and nature to develop oneself.\n\n## How it can help\n\nSeveral studies point towards increased well-being and higher quality of relations of the individual who engages in compassion training. In professional life, our leadership qualities improve if we understand the suffering of our colleagues and work towards alleviating it so that they can do their job properly.\n\n#### Learn more\n\nRead the [IDG Phase 2 Research Report](/assets/221215_IDG_Toolkit_v1.pdf) and get more in-depth information.","intro":"Compassion training can help build empathy and compassion, described as an ability to relate to others, oneself and nature with kindness and the intention to address related suffering.

We do the best we can with our available means.\n\n2. You can then direct your compassion towards another person that is close and relate to him or her the same way without judgment. After this, you can direct compassion to someone not that close, or someone you have a conflict with and wish that they are well, happy and in peace.\n\n3. Exercises can be added where you engage in alleviating others from suffering by practicing acts of generosity, hospitality or kindness towards the ones of your concern.","resources":"* Bristow, J., Bell, R. and Wamsler, C.

Personal agency interventions take the form of behavioral and/or digital interventions designed to catalyze actions towards specific goals and to support behavioral change. Examples include:\n\n- The Empowered Employee and Empowered Entrepreneur training (EET) programs, developed by Dr. Shankar and colleagues through the SEE Change Initiative. In these trainings, which are adapted to local contexts, individuals undertake a personal journey to understand their own belief systems, identify goals in several life areas and learn various mental tools to take purposeful action to achieve their goals. Specific skills in action planning include goal setting, improved communications, systematic planning, and active problem solving. \n\n- Personal initiative training, developed by psychologists Dr. Frese and colleagues. This training focuses on motivational skills, proactive behaviors, goal setting, planning and innovation and overcoming obstacles, and teaches participants how to anticipate problems, look for new opportunities, and plan ways to overcome obstacles. These training were designed for entrepreneurs and small businesses.\n\n## How it can help\n\nPersonal agency and personal initiative trainings can enable meaningful action towards the participant’s goals as well as forming cyclical, proactive habits that individuals can maintain throughout their life, enabling a growth mindset alongside a sense of power and voice.

It is a state in which one gathers information in quiet observation and deep listening, building knowledge by becoming aware. In this space of contemplation, the invisible inner qualities are working, which informs action. Allowing the time to pause is as important as the quality of the space created for that pause to happen.\n\nPausing to reflect is embodying what we just heard, and developing that inner quality of being more conscious during the process has the capability to change the outcome. When practicing in teams, pausing can also help us notice from which level of listening we are operating from Otto Scharmer’s four levels of listening: “downloading” (reconfirming what we know), “factual” (what is different from what we know), “empathic” (allows us to connect with the experience of the other), and “generative” (connects us with who we are and whom we want to be).\n\nPracticing listening more deeply to sense a deeper connection with the environment enables us to relate with our surroundings. Elder Miriam Rose Ungunmerr said we learn by watching and listening, waiting and then acting.\n\n## How it can help\nThe awareness gained in pausing forms the quality to act from a more conscious state of being.\n\n#### Learn more\n\nRead the [IDG Phase 2 Research Report](/assets/221215_IDG_Toolkit_v1.pdf) and get more in-depth information.","intro":"Pausing on what we just heard is an inner skill that enables connecting to “what the person just said” and “how those words landed on oneself”.

Mindfulness is not about emptying one’s mind or trying to control one’s thoughts or emotions, but it does involve paying attention in a particular way in order to become more in conscious charge of one’s attentional faculties. Mindfulness can be developed through practice.\n\nDeveloping mindfulness or mindful presence has been a central practice in many spiritual and religious traditions for millennia. During the last decades, it has been brought to the Western world at a bigger scale through clinical health care in the form of standardized programs called mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), which have been adapted to educational and workplace contexts. These typically include formal practices, such as sitting meditation, mindful movement and the ‘body scan’, as well as informal practices that bring awareness to everyday activities – pausing and responding mindfully where one might otherwise act through habit or impulse. Increasingly, explicit kindness and compassion-related exercises may also be included.\n\n## How it can help\n\nCultivating mindfulness helps increase awareness of one’s inner life, as well as the way one interacts with other people and the world. As such it may help the practitioner to establish a more conscious way of living on a day-to-day basis. For leaders and employees, the evidence-based effects of practicing mindfulness on a regular basis are improved focus and productivity, mental health and well-being, emotional processing, communication, connection with self, others, and nature, and support of collective and systems change.\n\n#### Learn more\n\nRead the [IDG Phase 2 Research Report](/assets/221215_IDG_Toolkit_v1.pdf) and get more in-depth information.","intro":"Mindfulness is the capacity to attend intentionally to present-moment experience, with an attitude of openness, curiosity, and care.

Choose an object, either internally like the sensation of breathing or externally such as a thing or sound in the environment, and begin with directing and resting the attention there.\n\n2. As one notices the mind wandering, one gently redirects the attention back to observing the object – without judgment and while allowing whatever is observed or felt to be as it is in that moment. Over time one can develop the ability to be with the totality of one’s experience in this way, even thoughts or difficult emotions, without getting swept away or overwhelmed.","resources":"* Baminiwatta, A., & Solangaarachchi, I.
