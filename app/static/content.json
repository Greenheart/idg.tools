A key principle in teams is a common intention. For aligning a core team to create a shared sense of purpose and direction, initial framing is important. Presencing practitioners sense into the interior conditions, asking organizations to consider the quality of spaces they create for deep inner and relational inquiry. For example, how to see, sense and feel the inner quality of team dynamics. The U-school offers a set of tools and practices to support holding spaces for transformation: Sensing Journeys, Dialogue Interview, Stakeholder Interview, Guided Journaling, Case Clinic Coaching Circles, Prototyping, and more. These practices are freely accessible and can be used independently and adapted to other transformative processes. \n\nHow it can help: Theory U offers insights and processes that enable working in a group to sense more deeply into team dynamics and conscious leadership relationships, helping organizations engage in purposeful planning, prototyping of projects and initiatives, and acting more purposefully.","actions":"When starting with Theory U and in particular Prototyping for the first time, try the following: \n\n1. Start by asking what problem the team wants to see, including the invisible forces in the system. \n\n2. Then, list the stakeholders within the organization and/or the actors that directly or indirectly relate to the situation. Represent invisible forces, such as dynamics of feelings, for example, power, frustration, with an object. Also consider distance between objects as well as shape and size. \n\n3. Reflect on the sculpture from four different perspectives: East (Feeling): What do you love in this sculpture that ignites your best energy? What frustrates you? South (Truth): What hard truths need to be spoken? West (Reflection): What assumptions might be underlying this situation? What systemic barriers lock us into the current state of operating? North (Purpose/Presence): What in this situation is ending, wanting to die, and what is emerging, wanting to be born? If this sculpture could speak, what advice might it offer? \n\n4. Give time to rearrange the sculpture to the current reality the team wants to see. What is the item or dynamic that, if removed or changed in position, will create a dramatic change within the sculpture?","link":"theory-u-for-group-work-and-prototyping-94b24hs"},{"resources":"* Bristow, J., Bell, R. and Wamsler, C.

Our ability for compassion can also temporarily decrease, such as in stressful or hostile situations or if we get stuck in our own judgements or unhealthy self-criticisms or even shame. The ability for compassion and self-compassion is an asset, and fortunately, it can be trained and developed. Compassion training that we will focus on here can be performed by different exercises such as meditation training. A common way of doing this exercise is to start with mindful awareness - connecting to oneself, one’s body and breath. Compassion training often aims to address one’s own suffering, which is self-compassion, but here we will address relations and others’ suffering. Voluntary work helping disadvantaged people and being conscious about one’s consumption of different resources are examples of supporting and connecting with other people and nature to develop oneself.\n\nHow it can help: Several studies point towards increased well-being and higher quality of relations of the individual who engages in compassion training. In professional life, our leadership qualities improve if we understand the suffering of our colleagues and work towards alleviating it so that they can do their job properly.","actions":"When starting with compassion training for the first time, try the following:\n\n1. Start with connecting to yourself, your inner, your body and your breath. You can then relate to yourself without judgment and self-criticism (self-compassion), meaning that you are not attached to your thoughts or feelings in this situation. We do the best we can with our available means.\n\n2. You can then direct your compassion towards another person that is close and relate to him or her the same way without judgment. After this, you can direct compassion to someone not that close, or someone you have a conflict with and wish that they are well, happy and in peace.\n\n3. Exercises can be added where you engage in alleviating others from suffering by practicing acts of generosity, hospitality or kindness towards the ones of your concern.","link":"compassion-training-t1524mi"},{"resources":"* Neff, K.

Personal agency interventions take the form of behavioral and/or digital interventions designed to catalyze actions towards specific goals and to support behavioral change. Examples include:\n\n* The Empowered Employee and Empowered Entrepreneur training (EET) programs, developed by Dr. Shankar and colleagues through the SEE Change Initiative. In these trainings, which are adapted to local contexts, individuals undertake a personal journey to understand their own belief systems, identify goals in several life areas and learn various mental tools to take purposeful action to achieve their goals. Specific skills in action planning include goal setting, improved communications, systematic planning, and active problem solving. \n\n* Personal initiative training, developed by psychologists Dr. Frese and colleagues. This training focuses on motivational skills, proactive behaviors, goal setting, planning and innovation and overcoming obstacles, and teaches participants how to anticipate problems, look for new opportunities, and plan ways to overcome obstacles. These training were designed for entrepreneurs and small businesses.\n\nHow it can help: Personal agency and personal initiative trainings can enable meaningful action towards the participant’s goals as well as forming cyclical, proactive habits that individuals can maintain throughout their life, enabling a growth mindset alongside a sense of power and voice. These trainings can directly improve livelihoods for small businesses and entrepreneurs as well as improve overall well-being for individuals living in resource poor environments.","actions":"When starting with personal agency and personal initiative training for the first time, try the following: \n\n1.

Part of psychological flexibility can be seen as increasing your inner space. The other half is directed towards committed action, which comes from working with identifying one’s values and building new behavior towards goals that are aligned with these values. \n\nAlthough the connection to individuals’ engagement in sustainability issues is not that direct, nothing in the practice says that the values you identify shouldn’t align with e.g. the planetary boundaries.\n\nACT is a non-profit, co-created open source initiative. One can take ACT therapy or ACT training, but evidence shows that the practitioner can achieve equal effects from learning through both books and face-to-face counseling.\n\nHow it can help: ACT and improving psychological flexibility have been demonstrated to have a number of positive effects, such as higher performance at cognitive tasks, increased quality in relations, decreased levels of stress and depression and decreased tendencies to get caught up in conspiracy theories. There are also exercises for developing long-term perspectives and orientation.\n\nContributor: Fredrik Livheim","actions":"When starting ACT for the first time, try the following: \n\n1.

The Symbiosis Meditation is a short (8 minute) example of an imagination activism meditation that invites you to explore your experience being alive through the vibrant material, energy, atoms, living beings and connections your experience of being a “human being” is made up of.\n\nHow it can help: Imagination activism can help create connection to the Earth, establish interconnectedness with nature, bring alive the concept of future generations, and foster an expanded sense of time. It also enables the exploration of alternative worlds and possibilities and allows the visioning of the future, inspiring hope and helping the practitioner find the steps to put vision into action.","actions":"Try the Symbiosis Meditation:\n\n1.

Move on to visualizing water and all of the liquid elements in your body, and then again visualizing the rivers, storms, waterfalls and oceans of the world outside. \n\n3. Move on to visualizing air and the breath, focusing on the air and oxygen bubbles inside the body and projecting out to the air and its sounds and sensations out in the world. \n\n4. Move on to visualizing the “fire element” of heat and energy which also guides listeners to imagine the mitochondria in the body that were once bacteria, but now live in our bodies. \n\n5. Finish by imagining the chain of unbroken relationships and cooperation, embodied through the chain of heartbeats that have supported them to be alive at this time.","link":"imagination-activism-and-the-symbiosis-meditation-86324pm"},{"resources":"- Bunker, B.

It is a state in which one gathers information in quiet observation and deep listening, building knowledge by becoming aware. In this space of contemplation, the invisible inner qualities are working, which informs action. Allowing the time to pause is as important as the quality of the space created for that pause to happen.\n\nPausing to reflect is embodying what we just heard, and developing that inner quality of being more conscious during the process has the capability to change the outcome. When practicing in teams, pausing can also help us notice from which level of listening we are operating from Otto Scharmer’s four levels of listening: “downloading” (reconfirming what we know), “factual” (what is different from what we know), “empathic” (allows us to connect with the experience of the other), and “generative” (connects us with who we are and whom we want to be).\n\nPracticing listening more deeply to sense a deeper connection with the environment enables us to relate with our surroundings. Elder Miriam Rose Ungunmerr said we learn by watching and listening, waiting and then acting.\n\nHow it can help: The awareness gained in pausing forms the quality to act from a more conscious state of being.\n\nContributor: Vivianna Rodriguez Carreon","actions":"When starting with listening to pause for the first time, try the following:\n\n1.

Write this down on a piece of paper. \n\n2. Think about the positive feelings and consequences that would result from achieving what you would like to achieve, big or small. Write these down and then focus for a little while on the two or three things that would be the single best in achieving this. \n\n3. Next, think about all the possible obstacles and problems that you can come up with that can make it difficult or prevent you from achieving what you want. Obstacles may lie with you (e.g. motivation problems, concentration difficulties, fatigue, illness). They can also lie outside of yourself (eg being misinformed, a colleague getting sick, bad weather). Write down all obstacles, big or small. \n\n4. For each obstacle, think through what you can do to prevent it from happening and what you can do to deal with it should it happen. Write down each such plan on the paper as follows: “For __________ not to happen, I will __________ and if __________ happens, I will __________.” \n\n5. Read through what you have written and feel free to tell someone else about what you have written.","link":"woop-p1d24vk"},{"resources":"- Edmonson, A. C. and Lei, Z. (2014).

The ITC process starts with an individual development goal, and explores our emotional reactions and assumptions when we try to pursue this goal.\n\nHow it can help: ICT can help put our assumptions into words and take them as an object, resulting in us no longer being owned by the assumption and losing control over us. That will then give us greater freedom and allow us to harbor more complexity in our inner space.","actions":"When starting the ICT process for the first time, try the following:\n\n1. Begin by setting an individual development goal, which could be to exercise more or set boundaries and say no to others’ expectations and wishes.\n\n2. When we try to pursue these goals and try to make a significant change in our lives, often something in us seems to resist the change and prevents us from changing our behavior to something that is unfamiliar to us. According to the process, this happens since this new behavior challenges assumptions we have about ourselves that we may not be aware of. Try to identify the assumptions that are preventing behavior change. For example, if I want to be better at saying no to others’ wishes, it may challenge my assumption that I see myself as someone that is needed by others.","link":"immunity-to-change-itc-process-i21248c"},{"resources":"* Laske, O.

DTF offers insights into unlocking our thought habits to see reality’s messiness and complexity beyond our attempts to categorize it. From a dialectical standpoint, it is more natural to find good questions and ask what’s missing than to provide answers. The framework is a collection of thought forms ordered in the four moments structure, process, relation and transformation.\n\nHow it can help: It can help the practitioner begin to see reality more as a process of evolving and developing, as phenomena in a larger, integral, interdependent context rather than as discrete things. This helps the practitioner see how things fit together and depend on each other for their existence rather than being isolated, building complexity awareness for the challenges we are solving.","actions":"When starting with DTF for the first time, try the following:\n\n1. Start by applying the dialectical framework to yourself, by thinking of yourself not as a static being but as an evolving and learning being that is in a development process. Consider yourself more as a part of the larger context, your organization, your culture and your lineage. And rather than seeing yourself as an individual having relations, you may acknowledge more how the relations you have define who you are.\n\n2. Identify a coach who can assess your individual ability for dialectical thinking through an interview. One’s thought patterns are identified and mind-opening exercises can support the development where needed.","link":"dialectical-thought-form-framework-oi322qb"},{"name":"Meaning-making in a Crisis","slug":"z56tzf1","intro":"In this course you will take the first step on a journey to a more meaningful life in these times of turmoil, based on what really matters to you, practice acceptance and work on finding your values.","relevancy":[{"skill":"ckzi3a4z90431e2n04kx2pbq2","score":90},{"skill":"ckzi3b8sz0614e2n0ijnnazce","score":70},{"skill":"ckzi3blfz0687e2n0huf88a8y","score":70},{"skill":"ckzi3hqs63163e2n03h36pb73","score":70},{"skill":"ckzi3dk3h1039e2n0qxij7ooh","score":60}],"tags":["cl4mbwmh400002e64dj6n7abw","cl4mbzx5z00042e64g1ueu8vj","cl37epfsz0159jgn0ytt4k64j"],"link":"meaning-making-in-a-crisis-z56tzf1","id":"cl44ijlka0007rmpzbqao4czu","description":"29k is a Swedish foundation and one of the initiating partners of the IDGs initiative. 29k's mission is to democratize access to inner development. 29k does this via a non-profit, open-source digital platform that provides free access to evidence-based psychological tools for mental health and inner development.

Mindfulness is not about emptying one’s mind or trying to control one’s thoughts or emotions, but it does involve paying attention in a particular way in order to become more in conscious charge of one’s attentional faculties. Mindfulness can be developed through practice.\n\nDeveloping mindfulness or mindful presence has been a central practice in many spiritual and religious traditions for millennia. During the last decades, it has been brought to the Western world at a bigger scale through clinical health care in the form of standardized programs called mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), which have been adapted to educational and workplace contexts. These typically include formal practices, such as sitting meditation, mindful movement and the ‘body scan’, as well as informal practices that bring awareness to everyday activities – pausing and responding mindfully where one might otherwise act through habit or impulse. Increasingly, explicit kindness and compassion-related exercises may also be included.\n\nHow it can help: Cultivating mindfulness helps increase awareness of one’s inner life, as well as the way one interacts with other people and the world. As such it may help the practitioner to establish a more conscious way of living on a day-to-day basis. For leaders and employees, the evidence-based effects of practicing mindfulness on a regular basis are improved focus and productivity, mental health and well-being, emotional processing, communication, connection with self, others, and nature, and support of collective and systems change.\n\nContributors: Lene Søvold, Christine Wamsler, Jamie Bristow","actions":"When starting a mindfulness practice for the first time, try the following:\n\n1. Choose an object, either internally like the sensation of breathing or externally such as a thing or sound in the environment, and begin with directing and resting the attention there.\n\n2. As one notices the mind wandering, one gently redirects the attention back to observing the object – without judgment and while allowing whatever is observed or felt to be as it is in that moment. Over time one can develop the ability to be with the totality of one’s experience in this way, even thoughts or difficult emotions, without getting swept away or overwhelmed.","link":"mindfulness-practices-14122oi"},{"resources":"* Kanter, J.
