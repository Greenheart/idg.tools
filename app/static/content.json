Observe the breath and whatever comes to one's attention (including one's thoughts, emotions and surroundings) - without judgement of what is observed or felt, or without trying to change anything. This might be quite difficult in the beginning, as it is easy to get entangled in, or annoyed by the different distractions we have in our lives/environment, or to react to pain or other unpleasant sensations in our bodies.

This has been demonstrated to have a number of positive effects, such as higher performance at cognitive tasks, increased quality in relations, decreased levels of stress and depression and decreased tendencies to get caught up in conspiracy theories.

From a dialectical standpoint, we look for what is excluded by our concepts and systems and use those excluded aspects to find the commonalities between things thus forming more inclusive thoughts. If you think of reality  as  static and individual, what happens if you apply the dialectical framework?. You might begin to see reality more as a process of evolving and developing. You would also likely see phenomena in a larger, integral, interdependent context. And rather than seeing phenomena as discrete things, you might begin to see that all things fit together. You might start to see how things depend on each other for their existence rather than being isolated.\n\nThere is a strong theoretical foundation to the DTF framework and through an interview, a person’s ability for dialectical thinking can be assessed. During the assessments, the person’s  patterns of thought are identified and mind-opening exercises can support the development where needed. It is then often used in coaching and counselling so the participant or client may, hopefully, improve their ability for dialectical thinking.\n\nLearn more in the section about the Dialectical Thought Form framework in the [IDG Field Kit](FIELD_KIT_LINK).","resources":"- Laske, O.

But it also facilitates our ability for complex thinking around our own emotions and meaning-making by using language as a tool to access what was previously hidden from us. This demonstrates how  language and being are intertwined and how hard it is to place a method in a certain category.\n\nThe ITC process is performed by individuals or in group sessions and starts with the participants setting an individual developmental goal, which could be to exercise more or set boundaries and say no to others’ expectations and wishes. When we try to pursue these goals and try to make a significant change in our lives, often something in us seems to resist the change. There seems to be some sort of emotional reaction, some sort of immune system that gets triggered, that prevents us from changing our behaviour to something that is unfamiliar to us. We may even start self-sabotaging our own development. According to the process, this happens since this new behaviour challenges assumptions we have about ourselves that we may not be aware of. If I want to be better at saying no to others’ wishes, it may challenge my assumption that I see myself as someone that is needed by others.\n\nLearn more in the section about the ITC process in the [IDG Field Kit](FIELD_KIT_LINK).","resources":"- Kegan, R. & Lahey, L.

We define empathy as the capacity to understand and feel what other people feel and compassion adds the wish to ease that suffering.\n\nThe ability for compassion and self-compassion is an asset, and fortunately, it can be trained and developed.\n\nThen, why would we be interested in developing our ability for compassion? First, several studies point towards increased well-being and higher quality of relations of the individual who engages in compassion training. Another argument for increasing our ability for compassion is that our leadership qualities improve if we understand the suffering of our colleagues and work towards alleviating it so that they can do their job properly.\n\nRecently, compassion has been shown to support transformative qualities and capacities (related all five clusters of awareness, insight, connection, purpose, and agency) as well as sustainability outcomes across individual, collective and system levels.\n\nLearn more in the section about compassion training in the [IDG Field Kit](FIELD_KIT_LINK).","resources":"* [https://www.themindfulnessinitiative.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=8d56bcb4-15a0-4b39-9236-064eb302ef99](https://www.themindfulnessinitiative.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=8d56bcb4-15a0-4b39-9236-064eb302ef99)\n\n* [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378021001527?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378021001527?via%3Dihub)\n* [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-022-03398-9](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-022-03398-9)","tags":["cl7lzp6jh00012e623q59s9pf","cl7lzoeqy00002e62ke8rog8l"],"actions":"- We need more concrete examples and resources of how to practice - welcome to contribute if you have ideas!","relevancy":[{"skill":"ckzi3ezut1614e2n07fab18pt","score":100},{"skill":"ckzi3ef9s1366e2n082dhihsm","score":100},{"skill":"ckzi3eor91487e2n0qdoa639u","score":80},{"skill":"ckzi3blfz0687e2n0huf88a8y","score":80},{"skill":"ckzi3e4as1251e2n0fz614xn4","score":70},{"skill":"ckzi3ayvo0547e2n03lvu0goo","score":70},{"skill":"ckzi3b8sz0614e2n0ijnnazce","score":60},{"skill":"ckzi3am4y0486e2n04obcy6hi","score":60},{"skill":"ckzi3a4z90431e2n04kx2pbq2","score":50},{"skill":"ckzi3d9gp0942e2n0lvc6k1nh","score":40},{"skill":"ckzi3gb7f2318e2n04kesx118","score":40},{"skill":"ckzi3hqs63163e2n03h36pb73","score":40},{"skill":"ckzi3g17e2167e2n055jpiaaz","score":30}],"link":"compassion-training-t1524mi"},{"id":"cl7qkz7q300062e64ynyxxctu","slug":"sl72413","name":"Nature quest","description":"As disconnection is one of the main root-causes of the social-ecological crisis we are in, reconnection is one of the key processes required to make our world more sustainable.

It is an inner skill that enables connecting to “what the person just said” and “how those words landed on oneself”. Allowing the time to pause is as important as the quality of the space created for that pause to happen. The importance of this quality had been highlighted without methodological steps in ancient wisdom and the western literature describing the listening process for discernment.\nThe invitation to pause lies in evidence-based sources to understand the awareness gained in pausing.\n\nDeep listening can also be viewed as a process. In the three key elements used in Theory U to open the mind, open the heart and open the will —to risk, Otto Scharmer, highlights listening as the most important and underrated skill. The 4 levels of listening are: “downloading” (reconfirming what we know), “factual” (what is different from what we know), “empathic” (allows us to connect with the experience of the other), and “generative” (connects us with who we are and whom we want to be). It is doable to be with others and inwardly, pausing in order to notice from which level of listening we are operating —downloading, factual, empathic, or generative.\n\nPausing to reflect is being conscious of the embodiment of what we just heard, and that inner quality has the capability during the process to change the outcome.\n\nLearn more in the section about \"Listening to pause\" in the [IDG Field Kit](FIELD_KIT_LINK).","resources":"- Atkinson, J.

Then you are guided to visualise all of the solidity and Earth element present in the world and Universe externally to you, and to visualise and imagine the connections between the two.\n\nThe same is done for water and all of the liquid elements in your body, and then again visualising the rivers, storms, waterfalls and oceans of the world outside - and the continuum that exists between the two. Then the same is done with air and the breath, focusing on the air and oxygen bubbles inside the body and projecting out to the air and its sounds and sensations out in the world. Lastly, the meditation focuses on the “fire element” of heat and energy which also guides listeners to imagine the mitochondria in the body that were once bacteria, but now live in our bodies through the process of endosymbiosis. The listener finishes by imagining the chain of unbroken relationships and cooperation, embodied through the chain of heartbeats that have supported them to be alive at this time.\n\nThe meditation mixes using cognitive ideas, concepts and visualisations from the sciences which are then brought alive by experiential practice, breath, contemplation, and embodied cognition to create a rigorous, feeling-based experience and intelligence of our interdependence with all Life.","relevancy":[{"skill":"ckzi3a4z90431e2n04kx2pbq2","score":85},{"skill":"ckzi3ezut1614e2n07fab18pt","score":80},{"skill":"ckzi3d9gp0942e2n0lvc6k1nh","score":80},{"skill":"ckzi3dtdk1142e2n0m9v02uf5","score":80},{"skill":"ckzi3b8sz0614e2n0ijnnazce","score":50},{"skill":"ckzi3blfz0687e2n0huf88a8y","score":50},{"skill":"ckzi3dk3h1039e2n0qxij7ooh","score":45},{"skill":"ckzi3gu6u2638e2n0fmr9gv86","score":40},{"skill":"ckzi3hqs63163e2n03h36pb73","score":40}],"tags":["cl80nkv7900002e64os1wgo0u","cl7lzp6jh00012e623q59s9pf","cl7lzoeqy00002e62ke8rog8l"],"actions":"- A recording of the symbiosis meditation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUIrEecXcHg&ab_channel=PhoebeTickell](A recording of the symbiosis meditation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUIrEecXcHg&ab_channel=PhoebeTickell)","resources":"- Moral Imaginations (Phoebe Tickell)\n- Moral Imagination: Implications of Cognitive Science for Ethics (Mark Johnson)\n- Fröding, B., & Osika, W.

Not only the interior of the one you are communicating with but also of yourself. As individuals, an NVC approach asks us to go beyond our first interpretation of what is being expressed and try to listen deeper. We can do this by, instead of instinctually responding as we were being attacked, asking further questions on how this person feels and about needs that are not being met.\n\nOpening ourselves up like this to welcome the perspective, and possibly suffering, of the other person or group may be more demanding for us than just reacting and defending ourselves. It requires that we can hold space within ourselves for the other person’s view and emotions without subsuming our own needs and emotions. But practising doing this in different situations may also contribute to the development of our inner space and capacity to harbour different emotions and perspectives. NVC opens a room for shared understanding and a deep sense of connectedness.\n\nLearn more in the section about Nonviolent communication in the [IDG Field Kit](FIELD_KIT_LINK).","actions":"Clear the Air Team Meetings (CTA) is one approach for implementing NVC in everyday life. It is a process for any group of people. The contribution to cooperation arises from providing a space for cultivating connection and clearing relational tensions. The aim is that whatever tensions arise can be promptly clarified. In this sense, CTA meetings are a kind of safety net for tensions: Here, issues that one may not have managed to address in everyday life can be clarified. The format invites teams to address and clarify conflicts by providing a clear structured space that starts with a deep check-in. Each person reflects for themselves: How am I feeling right now? What is on my mind these days? The second round is focused on clarifying tensions and conflicts. What follows after is a so-called appreciation round. The participants consider: What has someone in this round done that has met my needs? What have I come to appreciate in general over the past few weeks? Finally, there is a checkout round where participants are given the opportunity to share how they are doing compared to the beginning of the meeting and how they personally benefited from it.","tags":["cl7lzp6jh00012e623q59s9pf"],"resources":"- Rosenberg, M.

In particular when stakeholders with quite different interests, perspectives, roles and knowledge base are involved, there is also a considerable potential for miscommunication, lack of trust, lack of shared focus and outright conflict.\n\nOver the last five decades or so, a very large number of methods have been developed in order to scaffold productive collaboration and overcome interest conflicts among diverse stakeholders. Some examples (of very many) of such methods are: TIP, The Integral Process for Working on Complex Issues; Soft Systems Methodology; Open Space; Future Search; the Strategic Choice Approach, WorkOut, the Consensus-Based Approach, the Inquiry-Based Approach, Deep Democracy and Future Workshops.\n\nPicking one method from the diverse field of methods is problematic, since different methods have been developed for different purposes and have different profiles regarding what functions they perform (see Jordan, 2014).\n\nIn order to fully realize the potential of using methods for complex issues, it might be necessary to involve a trained and experienced facilitator. Such a facilitator can adapt the design of a group process to the specific conditions in the particular case, and can facilitate each phase of the process in order to mobilize the competences of the participants and ensure productive collaboration.\n\nLearn more in the [IDG Field Kit](FIELD_KIT_LINK).","actions":"- Using structured facilitation (either using an established method, or a bespoke design by a skilled facilitator) might be necessary in order to find consensus on purpose and delimitation, create trust and openness, mobilize creativity, explore complex conditions and causal relationships, make use of different perspectives, defuse conflicts, and other functions.","relevancy":[{"skill":"ckzi3g17e2167e2n055jpiaaz","score":80},{"skill":"ckzi3h80v2807e2n0l44d20qr","score":80},{"skill":"ckzi3cvpf0851e2n00bcmzsgz","score":70},{"skill":"ckzi3fnea2022e2n0r588if1r","score":70},{"skill":"ckzi3gb7f2318e2n04kesx118","score":70},{"skill":"ckzi3f9cj1747e2n0taoxah1j","score":60},{"skill":"ckzi3hi072982e2n0r4cdkqjy","score":60},{"skill":"ckzi3gknp2475e2n0dm59ikcn","score":60},{"skill":"ckzi3dtdk1142e2n0m9v02uf5","score":50}],"resources":"- Bunker, B.

Such diffe­rences (and others) can influence communication and collaboration practices, relationship building, leadership and followership and attitudes toward gender roles. Training in intercultural competence can include learning about common dimensions for cultural differences through lectures and reading, reflecting on others’ or own experiences with intercultural conflict, and conducting group simulations and communication exercises. It should be recognized, though, that some scholars and practitioners caution against the risks of stereotyping when using frameworks like Hofstede’s and advocate a more open-ended approach to training in intercultural awareness. Intercultural training should be designed to minimize the risk of stereotyping, while offering clear examples of how cultural differences potentially can be problematic, and providing guidance on insights and skills that increase the capacity for creative collaboration across cultural differences.\n\nThe volume of empirical research on intercultural differences is very large. There are also many books and articles written for the general public with the purpose of strengthening skills in intercultural collaboration. Training in intercultural competence has been around for a very long time, there is a large community of skilled trainers using different approaches.\n\nLearn more in the section about \"Training in intercultural competence\" in the [IDG Field Kit](FIELD_KIT_LINK).","tags":["cl7lzp6jh00012e623q59s9pf"],"resources":"- Chhokar, J.

Theory U offers insights and processes that enable working in a group to sense more deeply into team dynamics and conscious leadership relationships, helping organisations engage in purposeful planning and prototyping of projects and initiatives.\n\nFor example, Otto Scharmer said one of the key principles in teams is a common intention. How does a core team align to create a common intention? Initial framing is important, so a group has a shared sense of purpose and direction. Then as a group process is convened, group members are called upon to show up with authenticity and transparency, enabling the greatest attunement in the group. There is both an inward and an outward orientation of awareness, sensing into what wants to unfold in the group and what is happening in each individual. It is this awareness, directed to inner experience as well as to relational dynamics, that fosters organic emergence.\n\nLearn more in the section about \"Theory U for group work\" in the [IDG Field Kit](FIELD_KIT_LINK).","actions":"- The u-school offers a set of tools and practices to support holding spaces for transformation: Sensing Journeys, Dialogue Interview, Stakeholder Interview, Guided Journaling, Case Clinic Coaching Circles, Prototyping, and more.

WOOP is like taken from an instruction book for how to work on strengthening one's hope, the first characteristic of our psychological capital. You can do a WOOP pretty much as often as you want. It only takes a few minutes and only requires and put these minutes in and that you then wholeheartedly try to focus on the task.\n\nYou can do WOOP individually or with someone (for example, a coach, a colleague, a teammate, a leader, etc.). Doing it individually can be beneficial to have a paper and pen and write down your thoughts while you WOOP. In short, a WOOP works like this if you do it yourself","actions":"1. Sit down and close your eyes. Breathe in through your nose while counting to four and then hold your breath while counting to four again. Release the air through your mouth without pushing it out. Think of yourself as a balloon that you release the air from. Count to eight as you exhale and then count to four before doing it all over again the same way. Do this five to ten times and feel how you relax.\n\n2. Think of something you would like to achieve or experience in a given time, such as an upcoming meeting or the day ahead. For example, it could be something new that you would like to learn or an achievement of some kind that you would like to perform. Something that feels challenging but certainly not impossible. Write this down on a piece of paper.\n\n3. Think about the positive feelings and consequences that would result from achieving what you would like to achieve, big or small. Write these down and then focus for a little while on the two or three things that would be the single best in achieving this. Feel free to say these out loud and circle them on your paper.\n\n4. Next, think about all the possible obstacles and problems that you can come up with that can make it difficult or prevent you from achieving what you want. Obstacles may lie with you (e.g. motivation problems, concentration difficulties, fatigue, illness, etc.). They can also lie outside of yourself (eg being misinformed, a colleague getting sick, bad weather, etc.) Write down all the obstacles you can think of, big or small.\n\n5. For each obstacle, think through what you can do to prevent it from happening and what you can do to deal with it should it happen. Write down each such plan on the paper as follows: “For __________ not to happen, I will __________ and if __________ happens, I will __________.\n\n6. Read through what you have written and feel free to tell someone else about what you have written.","resources":"- Wang G, Wang Y, Gai X. A (2021).
