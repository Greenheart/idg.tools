# Inner Development Goals

> Transformational Skills for Sustainable Development

Welcome! This is a collection of free and open source projects supporting the [Inner Development Goals](https://www.innerdevelopmentgoals.org) (IDGs). The goal is to accelerate the implementation of the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals) (SDGs).

Our projects include:

-   [IDG.tools](https://idg.tools) - A free, open source and co-created library of tools and resources to help people and organizations practice inner development.
-   [IDG.community](https://idg.community) - A website created by and for the IDG community. A place to share stories and get involved in various activities.

### Localization & translation

To support the emerging IDG movement to become truly global, we need to make the IDGs both relevant and accessible to people all around the world. This is not just about translations - but also about adapting the content and language so that it makes sense in the local context.

We use [Weblate](https://weblate.org/) to coordinate our localization efforts. Welcome to contribute!
