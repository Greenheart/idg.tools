        Stories help us learn together with the global network and share inspiration and insights
        along the journey. Our vision is to bring people together, and create a vast library of
        stories exploring how to use the IDGs in practice to reach the SDGs.
    </p>

    <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-left">
        But to make this happen, our small editorial team needs your help. This is a
        community-driven project where you can make a meaningful contribution to not just learn more
        about the IDGs yourself - but also empower many others.
