            'The global study of transformational skills for sustainable development ”One-Question. Global Impact” is led and coordinated by IDG Inner Development Goals AB (svb) registered by organization number: 559314-0675 in Sweden. Inner Development Goals (IDGs) is a not for profit and open-source initiative owned to 100% by the Oak Island Foundation, a not for profit foundation in Sweden.\n\nThe responsibility for the ethical conduct and data handling lie with the IDGs. Executive Director Jan Artem Henriksson and Head of Research Co-creation, Dr. Fredrik Lindencrona, Phd lead this effort.\n\nThe study is conducted in collaboration between IDGs and many international academic partner institutions, IDG partner organizations & hubs and international networks to be able to reach as widely as possible across the globe.\n\nFor any questions, please contact:',

        whyText:
            "In 2015, all members of the United Nations agreed on 17 goals to build a world of peace, dignity and prosperity on a healthy planet. The initiative ”Inner Development Goals” is convinced that understanding and building transformational skills is essential to achieve this global ambition, critical for developing a sustainable future for humanity and planet.\n\nTo understand these transformational skills across the globe, we invite participants to make a Global Impact with one of the most inclusive studies ever on this theme. With your co-creation, we will achieve the vision of being a solid bridge between your knowledge and the impact of people's inner and outer development to manage a better world. Better people, better planet.\n\nThis process will develop a Global IDG Framework, for the first time solidly based on input from all around the world. Answers to this One-Big-Question will be analyzed and processed collaboratively by researchers in many countries across the world.",

        howText:
            'The global study is run as a distributed global collaborative process where country- and language based research team, established in as many countries as possible will collaborate.\n\nCountry teams will be coordinated by two co-leads who are able to work in the key languages of the participating countries and have at least earned a PhD in relevant areas. The teams will include up to ten co-researchers that represent a mix of the relevant cultural/language variations in the country.\n\nThe data for each country and language will be gathered anonymously through the same survey, administered through the Survey Monkey Platform (SMP) where possible and a special questionnaire where SMP is not feasible. In this case, SMP is ran from the Republic of Ireland within the European Union. No identifiable information about participants is collected without direct consent provided.\n\nAll teams will follow the same 4-phase process and ethical procedures (read more below). Active global coordination will happen through the team co-leads working with the core team led by the Head of Research Co-creation at IDGs. These meet regularly for support, learning and joint quality assurance throughout the four main phases.',

In parallel, information meetings have been conducted with so called multipliers (i.e international networks, global organizations, IDG Partner organizations & IDG Hubs) who are interested to help share the survey to a global audience. To get a comprehensive and inclusive dataset we aim at engaging at least 100 countries with 2M people who view the survey out which 100,000 respond. Researchers and multipliers have quality controlled the automatically generated translations of the survey.',

Multipliers will continually distribute the survey through social media, conferences, emails and other suitable distribution channels.',
        md_phaseText3:
            'Each country research team focuses on the material relevant for their country in one or several relevant languages. The process includes 4 steps:\n\n1. identify all relevant data to answer the One big question,  i.e. the individual and collective transformational skills (including qualities, abilities and skills) relevant to build a sustainable future for people and planet\n\n2. apply thematic analysis systematically to generate a list of transformational skills under each of the five dimensions being, thinking, relating, collaborating and acting\n\n3. co-leads from each country team collaborate to develop a joint comprehensive list of transformational skills and descriptions that can represent the width of concepts across all countries. The skills of the first IDG framework will be taken into account when this list is created to not loose consistency.\n\n4. This joint list will be used in a so called Delphi process to collect feedback on key prioritized transformational skills by all research team members and other respondents that have volunteered to be reached again for later stages of the survey process.\n\nIn addition to this process, qualitative data from groups that may not be able to respond to the survey and/or can be under-represented such as indigenous groups, migrants and people with low ability to read/write will be added to the material during different steps of the process.',
        md_phaseText4:
            'The process will result in a shared global list of transformational skills under the five dimensions of the IDG framework. This final list lay the ground for the Global IDG framework.  The global framework will be designed in collaboration between researchers, key communication specialists for the first IDG framework as well as users of the framework from policy and practice. The framework will be presented at the IDG Summit in October 2024. The global shared framework will be considered the formal framework as the shared concepts and symbols are critical to increase understanding globally.\n\nAfter the shared global framework is presented, each country/language team will start to relocalize the global shared framework to their specific context by revising the descriptions of transformational skills in alignment with what their local list (derived in earlier stages) suggest is necessary to make IDGs relevant in their context. Contextual appropriateness is an important quality to make IDGs work in each context.',
