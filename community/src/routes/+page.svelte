            framework in practice. Learn from others and try it with your local

    We're launching the IDG.community stories as an experiment. However, we need
    your help to sustain this, and realize the full potential. Therefore, we
    like to invite anyone who want to see more IDG community stories in the
    future to help out. This is a community-driven project, and a great
    opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to further help people engage
    with the IDGs to reach the SDGs.
