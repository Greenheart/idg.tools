    "description": "## About this course\n\nYou are not alone. Sometimes we find ourselves in situations we never expected.\n\nWhen we’re faced with a challenge, it’s perfectly normal to experience strong emotions such as stress, worry and anxiety. Experiencing difficult emotions can propel us into constructive action. But often we get stuck in our anxiety and engage in behaviors that make us feel worse instead.\n\nIn this course, you’ll learn a range of psychological tools that are proven to reduce the effects of overwhelm, anxiety and stress.\n\n## What will I learn?\n\n- Increase your ability to handle challenges\n- Practice to meet the situation as it is\n- Face difficult emotions and experiences\n\n## How does it work?\n\n- This course consists of 3 lessons.\n- By doing this course together with a group of friends, colleagues or other people in the 29k app, you gain more value from the course, and get support along the journey.\n- After completing each lesson, you can have a sharing session with your group to dive deeper into each topic. This is an opportunity to be present, learn from each other, and create a safe space for meaningful human connection.\n\n#### Who created this course?\n\nThe course was crafted by the psychologists at 29k in collaboration with teachers and researchers from the university Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\n#### About 29k\n\n29k is a Swedish foundation and one of the initiating partners of the IDGs initiative. 29k's mission is to democratize access to inner development. 29k does this via a non-profit, open-source digital platform that provides free access to evidence-based psychological tools for mental health and inner development.
