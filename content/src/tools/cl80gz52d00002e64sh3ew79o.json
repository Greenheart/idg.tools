    "description": "Pausing is key to consider what we just heard. It is an inner skill that enables connecting to “what the person just said” and “how those words landed on oneself”. Allowing the time to pause is as important as the quality of the space created for that pause to happen. The importance of this quality had been highlighted without methodological steps in ancient wisdom and the western literature describing the listening process for discernment.\nThe invitation to pause lies in evidence-based sources to understand the awareness gained in pausing.\n\nDeep listening can also be viewed as a process. In the three key elements used in Theory U to open the mind, open the heart and open the will —to risk, Otto Scharmer, highlights listening as the most important and underrated skill. The 4 levels of listening are: “downloading” (reconfirming what we know), “factual” (what is different from what we know), “empathic” (allows us to connect with the experience of the other), and “generative” (connects us with who we are and whom we want to be). It is doable to be with others and inwardly, pausing in order to notice from which level of listening we are operating —downloading, factual, empathic, or generative.\n\nPausing to reflect is being conscious of the embodiment of what we just heard, and that inner quality has the capability during the process to change the outcome.\n\nLearn more in the section about \"Listening to pause\" in the [IDG Field Kit](FIELD_KIT_LINK).",

    "actions": "- For example, in groups, each person can be given the same amount of time for communicating, followed by one (or more) minute of pausing, then the next person can speak for the same amount of time, and so on. In that pause, before it is the next person’s turn to talk, is when the magic happened. It shifts from reaction to being able to respond.",
