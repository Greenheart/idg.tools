    "description": "Psychological safety refers to the experience of being able to be oneself in a group without fear of being rejected or ridiculed by other group members. Teams with a high degree of psychological safety are open about their mistakes and are encouraged to talk about and learn from them. The concept of psychological safety applies to groups/teams and organisational settings where individuals are highly dependent on each other and are working towards a common goal. Without the help from all individuals in the group, the goal is hard to reach.\n\nPsychological safety is best conceptualized as a group phenomena, but it cannot be achieved without engagement from all team members. Individual awareness and actions will contribute to increased psychological safety in a group they are a part of.\n\n## How it can help\n\nA high degree of psychological safety can lead to increased performance, increased learning, and higher work satisfaction.\n\n#### Learn more\n\nRead the [IDG Phase 2 Research Report](/assets/221215_IDG_Toolkit_v1.pdf) and get more in-depth information.",
    "actions": "When starting with psychological safety for the first time, try the following:\n1. Ask questions and be interested in and respectful to other group members.\n2. Accept differences in personality by making sure everyone is included in conversations and decisions and actively asking for the opinion of others.\n3. Speak up about your own mistakes"
