    "description": "## About the course\n\nIn our everyday life, we can easily lose touch with what matters to us, especially when we’re dealing with a challenging situation or going through a crisis. That is also when we tend to give up on activities that recharge our batteries.\n\nConnecting to our deepest values is a powerful tool that helps us take meaningful actions in any area of our life. Even when the world around us seems ‘upside down’, we have the opportunity to reboot our lives and lead them in a more meaningful direction.\n\n## What will I learn?\n\n- Guide to finding your values\n- Live a more meaningful life\n- Acceptance\n- Opening up to life\n\n## How does it work?\n\n- This course consists of 4 lessons.\n- By doing this course together with a group of friends, colleagues or other people in the 29k app, you gain more value from the course, and get support along the journey.\n- After completing each lesson, you can have a sharing session with your group to dive deeper into each topic. This is an opportunity to be present, learn from each other, and create a safe space for meaningful human connection.\n\n#### About 29k\n\n29k is a Swedish foundation and one of the initiating partners of the IDGs initiative. 29k's mission is to democratize access to inner development. 29k does this via a non-profit, open-source digital platform that provides free access to evidence-based psychological tools for mental health and inner development.
