    "description": "Theory U, also known as ‘Presencing’, offers a framework for collaboration and engagement using awareness-based and contemplative practices. Theory U offers insights and processes that enable working in a group to sense more deeply into team dynamics and conscious leadership relationships, helping organisations engage in purposeful planning and prototyping of projects and initiatives.\n\nFor example, Otto Scharmer said one of the key principles in teams is a common intention. How does a core team align to create a common intention? Initial framing is important, so a group has a shared sense of purpose and direction. Then as a group process is convened, group members are called upon to show up with authenticity and transparency, enabling the greatest attunement in the group. There is both an inward and an outward orientation of awareness, sensing into what wants to unfold in the group and what is happening in each individual. It is this awareness, directed to inner experience as well as to relational dynamics, that fosters organic emergence.\n\nLearn more in the section about \"Theory U for group work\" in the [IDG field-kit](FIELD_KIT_LINK).",
