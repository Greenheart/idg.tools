    "description": "Imagination activism is a new kind of activism that pairs imagination exercises with calls to action in community to enact the better world we envision. By imagining a different future, fueled by a deep sense of connection to self, others and planet, activists can sustain themselves through hope and inspire others to create the kind of flourishing world they imagine. The Symbiosis Meditation is a short (8 minute) example of an imagination activism meditation that invites you to explore your experience being alive through the vibrant material, energy, atoms, living beings and connections your experience of being a “human being” is made up of.\n\n## How it can help\n\nImagination activism can help create connection to the Earth, establish interconnectedness with nature, bring alive the concept of future generations, and foster an expanded sense of time. It also enables the exploration of alternative worlds and possibilities and allows the visioning of the future, inspiring hope and helping the practitioner find the steps to put vision into action.\n\n#### Learn more\n\nRead the [IDG Phase 2 Research Report](/assets/220927_IDG_Toolkit_v6.pdf) and get more in-depth information.",
    "actions": "When starting with the Symbiosis Meditation for the first time, try the following:\n\n1. Start by visualizing all parts of your body that are made up of elements of solid material, or “Earth element” - bones, skin, teeth, hair, and the physical sensation of their weight. Then visualize all of the solidity and Earth elements present in the world, and imagine the connections to you. \n\n2. Move on to visualizing water and all of the liquid elements in your body, and then again visualizing the rivers, storms, waterfalls and oceans of the world outside. \n\n3. Move on to visualizing air and the breath, focusing on the air and oxygen bubbles inside the body and projecting out to the air and its sounds and sensations out in the world. \n\n4. Move on to visualizing the “fire element” of heat and energy which also guides listeners to imagine the mitochondria in the body that were once bacteria, but now live in our bodies. \n\n5. Finish by imagining the chain of unbroken relationships and cooperation, embodied through the chain of heartbeats that have supported them to be alive at this time."
