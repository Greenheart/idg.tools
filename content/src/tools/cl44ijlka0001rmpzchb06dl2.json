    "description": "As a leader, this course will equip you with a variety of psychosocial skills that will enable you to more reliably and successfully implement evidence-based leadership strategies.\n\nFrom ‘tried-and-tested’ techniques as goal setting, strategic planning, providing job control to colleagues, and effectively communicating meaningful messages, especially during times of change and uncertainty.\n\n## About the course\n\nAs Leadership is such a critical skill that runs through every aspect of our lives, from planning a family holiday to running a multinational company people can lead in so many different situations in different ways. \n\nBecause of this, the course aims to transform people's ability to lead using the skills and knowledge they have to lead to pursue purpose in any situation they're involved in even if the words CEO, director, or manager aren't in their title.\n\nFor the first time, this course draws together the fragmented fundamentals of effective leadership and gold standard approaches using a cutting edge model that unifies them to pursue success and satisfaction and elevate them above the sum of a disconnected set of separate leadership techniques.\n\nPurposeful Leadership is based upon a psychosocial model of human behaviour, successful living, and fulfillment called ALIVE.\n\nIt involves three, inseparable actions that allow people to make sense of and use their situation for the purpose of pursuing success and fulfillment, by\n\n* Understanding your current situation\n* Discovering what actions are worth undertaking\n* Committing to taking them\n\n## What will I learn?\n\nThis course empowers you to become a more Purposeful Leader. By drawing on the latest research in leadership and Psychology, you'll learn how to create a deep sense of meaning, for yourself, and the people around you.\n\nThe course comprises of 8 weekly lessons, exercises and daily quests to supercharge your learning. Each week, you'll grow in your ability to lead, thanks to engaging lessons, exercises and daily quests for reinforced learning.\n\n## How does it work?\n\n- This course consists of 8 lessons.\n- By doing this course together with a group of friends, colleagues or other people in the 29k app, you gain more value from the course, and get support along the journey.\n- After completing each lesson, you can have a sharing session with your group to dive deeper into each topic. This is an opportunity to be present, learn from each other, and create a safe space for meaningful human connection.\n\n#### Who created this course?\n\nProfessor Frank Bond and Dr Jonathan Dowling from the Institute of Management Studies at Goldsmiths, University of London.\n\n#### About 29k\n\n29k is a Swedish foundation and one of the initiating partners of the IDGs initiative. 29k's mission is to democratize access to inner development. 29k does this via a non-profit, open-source digital platform that provides free access to evidence-based psychological tools for mental health and inner development. All interventions are co-created together with leading researchers on the topic in question. Check out more at [www.29k.org](https://29k.org).",
