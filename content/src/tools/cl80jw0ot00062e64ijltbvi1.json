    "description": "Personal agency, defined as the ability to make and act upon important decisions in oneâ€™s life, is central in the promotion of overall well-being (Bandura, 1989;2006). Recent research studies from psychology, cognitive science, economics, and public health have demonstrated that personal agency can be nurtured, even within populations faced with significant resource constraints and environmental threats.\n\nPersonal-agency interventions take the form of behavioral and/or digital interventions designed to catalyze actions towards specific goals and to support behavioral change.\n\nIn the past decade, there has been an increase in personal agency interventions designed to catalyze and support the following sustainable development goals: Goal 1) no poverty, Goal 3) enhancing health and well-being, Goal 5) gender equality and Goal 8) decent work and economic growth.\n\nLearn more in the section about \"Personal agency and personal initiative trainings\" in the [IDG Field Kit](FIELD_KIT_LINK).",
    "actions": "Three specific examples of tested interventions in low resource settings are described in the [IDG Field Kit](FIELD_KIT_LINK):\n\n1. Empowered Employee training\n2.
