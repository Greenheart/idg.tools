    "description": "People mainly protect and restore the natural world for the sake of relational values: due to attachment to a special place in nature and in general due to the feeling of being connected with nature. Our level of connection to nature increases with time spent outdoors, especially with time spent in wild nature. Nature quests further develop emotional connection to the natural world, and deepen our awareness towards the environment and the relationship between humankind and the natural world.\n\n## How it can help\n\nExpanding our sense of self so that it includes the natural world can foster pro environmental behavior, as we will be less likely to harm it because harming the natural world would then be experienced like self-destruction.\n\n#### Learn more\n\nRead the [IDG Phase 2 Research Report](/assets/220927_IDG_Toolkit_v6.pdf) and get more in-depth information.",
    "actions": "When starting with a nature quest for the first time, try the following:\n\n1. Start by going on a walk in a forest and focus on relating to your surroundings, e.g. by naming the trees. Be aware of issues connected to nature such as environmental pollution, and the related actions you can take, e.g. not leaving trash behind.\n\n2. Observe what is already there: listen to the sounds around you, feel the ground which is carrying you, smell the air, taste it, and sink into your visual field. The aim is to leave everyday habits and patterns behind so that something new can emerge.\n\n3. Explore questions that may come to mind on the walk, such as: What is nature? And why does it matter? What is humanity's relationship to the natural world?"
