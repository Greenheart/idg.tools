    "description": "As disconnection is one of the main root-causes of the social-ecological crisis we are in, reconnection is one of the key processes required to make our world more sustainable. We need to reconnect both to ourselves as well as to the natural world. Research shows that we mainly protect and restore the natural world for the sake of relational values: due to attachment to a special place in nature and in general due to the feeling of being connected with nature. The assumption is that if we feel connected to nature, we will be less likely to harm it because harming the natural world would then be experienced like self-destruction.\n\nResearch shows that our level of connection to nature increases with time spent outdoors, especially with time spent in wild nature.\n\nLearn more in the section about the Dialectical Thought Form framework in the [IDG field-kit](FIELD_KIT_LINK).",
    "actions": "* You can do a nature quest by participating in an organised retreat or by organising your own trip into nature. Wherever you go, in the end, it is always about reconnecting with the web of life, with our sense of belonging and oneness. We experience that nature is not only around us but that we are nature inside and recognize that we as humans are inseparable from the natural world.",
