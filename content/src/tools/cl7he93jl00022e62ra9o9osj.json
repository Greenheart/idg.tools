    "description": "How can we create healthier human systems by working together with complex issues and shared leadership, and what does compassion have to do with it?\n\nPeter Senge leads this IDGs gathering and shares his wealth of experience in this area, joined in a panel with Ren√©e Lertzman and Michiel Bakker.\n\nAbout IDGs Gatherings:\nThis event series is a meeting place where people, organizations and thought leaders come together to explore various aspects of the IDGs and how they can help achieve the SDGs. A meeting place with emphasis on mutual learning, inspiration and co-creation - rather than one way communication by experts.\n\nAre you curious to explore the IDGs with other community members?
