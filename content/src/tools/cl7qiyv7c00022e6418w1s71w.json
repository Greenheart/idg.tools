    "description": "The Polarity Map is a wisdom organizer. The wisdom is in you. At the top of the map is your GPS – Greater Purpose Statement, for example “personal growth.” At the bottom is the Deeper Fear of what will happen if you do not leverage this polarity well, for example “stuck” which indicates a lack of personal growth.\n\nHow it can help: The 8 sections of the map help you identify and manage seemingly unsolvable or paradoxical problems.\n\nContributor: Barry Johnsson",
