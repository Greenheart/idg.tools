    "description": "One of the 23 skills is Empathy and Compassion, which we describe as an ability to relate to others, oneself and nature with kindness, empathy and compassion and the intention to address related suffering. We define empathy as the capacity to understand and feel what other people feel and compassion adds the wish to ease that suffering.\n\nThe ability for compassion and self-compassion is an asset, and fortunately, it can be trained and developed.\n\nThen, why would we be interested in developing our ability for compassion? First, several studies point towards increased well-being and higher quality of relations of the individual who engages in compassion training. Another argument for increasing our ability for compassion is that our leadership qualities improve if we understand the suffering of our colleagues and work towards alleviating it so that they can do their job properly.\n\nRecently, compassion has been shown to support transformative qualities and capacities (related all five clusters of awareness, insight, connection, purpose, and agency) as well as sustainability outcomes across individual, collective and system levels.\n\nLearn more in the section about compassion training in the [IDG field-kit](FIELD_KIT_LINK).",
