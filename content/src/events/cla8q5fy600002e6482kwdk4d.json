    "description": "If we are to move forward and bring the power of collective intelligence to solve global challenges faced by humanity, we must reclaim our human interconnectedness. This interconnectedness — and the empathy it fosters — will be essential to our ability to move forward together.\n\nIn this gathering, Radhika Vachani, founder of the Institute of Inner Well-being & Excellence (IWE) and author of Just Breathe, shares her extensive 25-year journey with inner well-being, which included studying with renowned yoga and meditation masters in India. She offers her perspectives and an experiential practice to demonstrate how we might awaken to a deep inner awareness and reclaim our interconnectedness as a human race.\n\nSign up and learn more: https://idg-gathering-dec08.confetti.events/"
